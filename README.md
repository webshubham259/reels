## Instructions

It is very important that you read the post's caption on the respective platform. The caption provides information that will help you navigate the repo to help you find the snippet that you are looking for.

The general caption format is as follows
>‚ú® CSS buttons 01
>
>The completed code can be found on GitHub within the 'Reels/Buttons/01' repo.
>
>If you found this content useful, please tap the ‚ô•Ô∏è icon and give me a follow. I would greatly appreciate it. Also, if you have any feedback, questions or concerns, let me know in the comments section üí¨. Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è

In the given caption example, the path specified means navigate to the `Reels` repo, then the `Buttons` folder, and finally the `01` folder. This is where the code for that particular reel will be. In order to avoid further confusion, the `numbered` folder will include a thumbnail of the project as well.

## License

I'm too lazy to include one of those fancy licenses; just know that you can use these code snippets as you see fit.
